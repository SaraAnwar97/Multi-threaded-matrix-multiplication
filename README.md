# Multi-threaded-matrix-multiplication
## About
Implemented two variations of matrix multiplication:<br>
a) The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread. <br>
b) The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread. <br>
For both variations, the elapsed time is computed and compared.

## Operating System:
Linux

## Compiling:
gcc -o matrix matrix.c -pthread

## Running:
